# MOEC-ASC
Repository for the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm competition from the Soft Computing Applications subject.
This repository includes:
* All .py files for running the algorithm
* Jupyter Notebook containing tests that can be run as cells
* C code for hypervolume, spacing and set coverage
* TESTS folder, with separated subfolders for each problem, evaluation budget (4000 or 10000) and individual test, containing graphics with Pareto fronts, hypervolume, spacing and set coverage between this algorithm and NSGAII

To run the tests, simply open the notebook with Jupyter, run the first three cells (imports, declaration of the ZDT3 function, and declaration of the CF6 function), and then run all cells for any desired test. It will generate the no. of unique solutions and a graph comparing the calculated front with the one generated by NSGAII.
